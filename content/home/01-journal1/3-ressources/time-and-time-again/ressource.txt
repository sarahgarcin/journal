Title: Time and time again

Text: 

The idea of time is familiar, yet it is hard to come to grips with. Therefore I prefer the phlegmatic definition from physics: time is what a clock reads. However, there is more to be said when time is considered from this area of knowledge. Some of it may be counterintuitive. The first thing is: time is an emerging phenomenon, a consequence of things that happen. Before the Big Bang there was no time, since nothing happened. 
On the website item “temps qui s’écoule...” it says that Newton envisioned time as a “donnée universelle”, which is correct, in the sense that Newton was wrong. 
With Einstein things are a bit more complicated than the jump from “s’écouler à ritmes différents” to “expériences individuelles”. Time does not adapt to different rhythms. Rather it defines rhythm and elongates with increasing speed. This is not an individual experience but a scientific fact. If, for instance in Paris, you take two very precise synchronous clocks and put one on an jet airplane and fly it to Sidney and back you will be able to measure that the clock that made the trip is lagging behind the clock that stayed home. That is the implication of relativity. At very high speeds during longer trips, say to Mars and back with a spaceship, the difference between the clocks may become considerable. Einstein’s genius has been the unveiling of natural phenomena that you cannot perceive.
It certainly is true, on the other hand, that the experience of time is an illusion. It depends on many things. One of those is age. This is a consequence of living gradually turning from something you have to learn by experiencing all that is new, into something that you can do without thinking, intuitively. You do stuff while thinking about other things and time flies. When you don’t do anything, being bored stiff on your flight to Mars, time takes ages.
