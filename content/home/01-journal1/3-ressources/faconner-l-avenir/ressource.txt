Title: Façonner l'Avenir

Text: 

Façonner l’Avenir entails dealing with la toupie. It requires preparation to be able to adapt to changing circumstances. It needs to be prepared for evolution. It occurs to me that both workshops focus on reuse and redefinition of what there is. Currently this is a common concern among designers. I would like to see more positive involvement in future opportunities.

“In time and place” (guided by Eugenia Morpurgo) is oriented towards the local and to waste materials that can be provided with a new purpose through the means of fablab.  If the workshop is to address the future there is also potential in exploring new global opportunities for information and production technologies and new concepts to cultivate value in objects, labour and social scenarios. Fablab is just a stage. Clearing up the now is a chore. Exploring future opportunities is urgent and inspirational.

“En temps et lieu” (guided by Laurent Tixador) as I understand it, is a sequence of group interventions from which transition will emerge. This means that it concerns “des séquences de maintenants”. There may be extra opportunities in interventions that foresee future circumstances, thereby creating possibilities “après temps et lieu”: survival beyond the people currently involved and also beyond the current cultural context. Let it spin.
