Title: Value

----

Text: 

Design involves value. Traditionally the work of a designer is regarded from an economical perspective. She or he is supposed to create added value, up to the moment in time when the product at hand is ready. Then it is produced and sold. Consequently value looses concern. This is the typical sell more sell faster business model. Designers often are not aware that they operate within the constraints of this very model. 
To enhance the probability of future health and convenience we need to adjust the way in which we address value. With the insight that it is a complex parameter, to which design can only partly contribute, the effort should be in cultivating value rather that adding it.  Value needs support in time. Nothing is ever finished. As a matter of fact neither are business plans. This is what ‘La toupie des valeurs’ illustrates. It needs effort to be kept upright.
