The observations by Auguste Hazemann concerning the value of labour and the time bank are quite intriguing. It immediately leads to considerations about value in relation to social impact. If football star Messi plays one match watched by 500 million people (500Megapeople, or Mp), in a video monitored stadium (which Sloterdijk calls a ‘collector’ (of attention)) I’m inclined to think that Messi’s two hours carry much more value than the two hours of each individual viewer. You, the reader, may hold a different position. Here we arrive at the essence of value. 

Value is an individual complicated intuition, brought forward by social convention, knowledge, mood, calculation, estimation, which is susceptible to negotiation. The intuition of value can easily be manipulated, among other principles by the “Anchor effect” as described by Daniel Kahneman.
